# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management guide. This documentation provides a comprehensive framework for delivering cross-functional projects with clarity, consistency, and quality. OctoAcme's approach is built on five core principles: putting customers first, delivering iteratively, establishing clear ownership, making data-informed decisions, and fostering psychological safety. These principles guide every phase of our project lifecycle and shape how our teams collaborate to deliver value.

OctoAcme follows a structured five-phase project lifecycle: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. Each phase includes clear governance gates, defined artifacts, and specific quality checkpoints to ensure projects stay on track and aligned with business objectives. During Initiation, we validate business needs and secure stakeholder alignment before proceeding. Planning transforms approved initiatives into actionable delivery plans with prioritized backlogs and defined success criteria. Execution focuses on day-to-day delivery with structured team rhythms including daily standups, weekly syncs, and sprint demos. Release ensures quality through pre-deployment checklists and post-deployment verification. Finally, Retrospectives capture learnings to drive continuous improvement across teams.

Our project teams are composed of key personas with distinct responsibilities: **Product Managers** define strategy and prioritize the backlog; **Project Managers** coordinate delivery and manage risks; **Developers** build and test features while identifying technical challenges; and **QA Engineers** ensure quality standards are met. Communication flows through well-defined channels with weekly PM/Product Manager syncs, twice-weekly standups, and escalation paths for blockers. We maintain transparency through shared artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, risk registers, and retrospective action items.

Quality assurance is deeply embedded in our workflow with multiple checkpoints throughout the delivery process. All code changes require pull request reviews with clear size limits (under 400 lines), automated CI validation, and at least one approval before merging. Our testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and security scanning. We track key metrics such as velocity, burndown charts, and success metrics to inform decisions and identify areas for improvement. Risk management is proactive with regular risk register reviews, structured mitigation plans, and clear escalation procedures to address issues before they impact delivery.
