# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

**Facilitation:**
- **Scrum Master:** Primary facilitator for retrospectives
- **Project Manager:** May co-facilitate or support action item tracking
- All team roles participate: Developers, QA/Testers, UX/UI Designers, Business Analysts, Technical Writers, Product Managers

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- **Scrum Master** tracks action item completion and reports on progress
- **Project Manager** ensures action items are resourced and prioritized
- **Technical Writer** may document process improvements for broader team knowledge sharing
