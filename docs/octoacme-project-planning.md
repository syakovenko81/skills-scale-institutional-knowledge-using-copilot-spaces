# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team *(Project Manager, Scrum Master)*
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria *(Product Manager, Business Analyst)*
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) *(Developers, QA/Testers)*
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) *(Team consensus facilitated by Scrum Master)*
5. Identify dependencies and integration points *(Developers, Project Manager)*
6. Create release plan and milestone map *(Project Manager, Product Manager)*
7. Draft initial test strategy and approach *(QA/Tester)*
8. Define design handoff and review process (if applicable) *(UX/UI Designer)*

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length *(Scrum Master facilitates)*
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria *(Product Manager, Business Analyst)*
- Ensure team capacity is respected *(Project Manager, Scrum Master)*
- Confirm design assets are ready for implementation *(UX/UI Designer)*
- Identify items requiring QA collaboration *(QA/Tester)*

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
- **Cross-role collaboration:**
  - **Developers** identify technical risks and dependencies
  - **QA/Testers** flag testing resource constraints and quality risks
  - **UX/UI Designers** raise design timeline or usability risks
  - **Project Manager** maintains risk register and coordinates mitigation
  - **Business Analyst** identifies business or stakeholder-related risks
